# VulnTestHTML
A github pages website where I put a bunch of things for vuln testing.
Well this whole thing was a failure that I spent about two hours of my time on.
If a piece of HTML is local, then you can go into folders and download things from file:// origins.
If it is not local (on github pages for example) then you cannot.
I was tricking myself that it would work this whole time
then I upload it to github
and this happens
HOW DARE BROWSER DEVS TRY TO STOP SECURITY VULNS REEEREREREREREEEEWEEEEERREREREREREREREREERERERERER]

this is a working repo if you download it
or have an insecure browser

So thats a bit sad.
Cope.
